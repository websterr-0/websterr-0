# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Websterr, and I'm thrilled to have you visit my GitHub profile.

I'm a passionate beginner in the world of coding with a huge goal ahead of me: to create a build planner for the game **"The First Descendant"**.

## ðŸš€ About Me

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the ropes of programming.
- ðŸŽ¯ My primary goal is to develop a comprehensive build planner for **"The First Descendant"**.
- ðŸ’¡ I'm always open to learning new technologies and improving my skills.

## ðŸŽ® The First Descendant Build Planner Project

### Project Overview
**The First Descendant** is a game that I am very interested in, and I'm on a mission to create a build planner tool that will help players optimize their characters and strategies. This project will be a robust and user-friendly application, allowing users to:

- Plan and customize their builds.
- Compare different strategies and loadouts.
- Share their builds with the community.

### Project Goals
- **User Interface (UI)**: Design a clean and intuitive UI for easy navigation.
- **Backend Development**: Implement a reliable and efficient backend to handle user data and build calculations.
- **Database Management**: Set up a database to store and manage various builds and configurations.
- **Community Features**: Allow users to share and rate each other's builds.

## ðŸ’¬ Let's Collaborate!

If you have any advice, suggestions or just want to say hi then please feel free to reach out. I'm always excited to meet fellow developers and gamers.

Thank you for visiting my profile. Stay tuned for updates!
